	DATA CLEANING
    -------------------- */

-- Find where blank cells are (columns age and region)
SELECT * from insurance_data
where claim = '';

-- Turn off safe mode to make changes
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

-- Delete blank columns for data integrity
DELETE FROM insurance_data
WHERE age = '' OR region = '';

-- Rename PatientID column 
ALTER TABLE insurance_data
RENAME COLUMN PatientID TO patient_id;

-- Turn safe mode back on
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;

	DATA ANALYSIS
    -------------------- */

-- 1. What age has the highest amount of claims, on average? (ANS: 22!)
SELECT
	age, 
    ROUND(AVG(claim), 2) AS total_claims
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY total_claims DESC;
    
-- 2. On average, what region has the highest claim amount? (The North East!)
SELECT
	region, 
    ROUND(AVG(claim), 2) AS total_claims
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_claims DESC;

-- 3. On average, do smokers have higher claim costs? (ANS: yes, big time. almost 4X the claim amount for smokers).
SELECT
	smoker, 
    ROUND(AVG(claim), 2) AS total_claims
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY smoker
ORDER BY total_claims;

-- 4. Do people who have more kids smoke more? What's the relation to claims? (ANS: No! as num kids increase, smoking decreases)
SELECT
	children, 
    COUNT(smoker) AS num_smokers,
    ROUND(AVG(claim)) AS avg_claims
FROM insurance_data
WHERE smoker = 'Yes'
GROUP BY children
ORDER BY num_smokers;

-- 5. Does having high blood pressure indicate higher claims?
SELECT
	bloodpressure,
    ROUND(claim) AS claims
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY bloodpressure
ORDER BY claims DESC;

-- 6. Is there a correlation between having more children and higher claim costs?
SELECT
	children,
    ROUND(AVG(claim)) AS total_claims
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY children
ORDER BY total_claims DESC; 

-- 7. Total children per region
SELECT
	region,
    SUM(children) AS total_children
FROM insurance_data
GROUP BY region;

-- 8. What are the average claim amounts for each class of BMI? (underweight, healthy weight, over weight, and obese).
SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(CASE
			WHEN bmi BETWEEN 18 AND 24 THEN claim
            ELSE NULL
            END), 2) AS normal_bmi_claim_avg,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE
			WHEN bmi BETWEEN 25 AND 29 THEN claim
            ELSE NULL
            END), 2) AS overweight_bmi_claim_avg,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE
			WHEN bmi >= 30 THEN claim
            ELSE NULL
            END), 2) AS obese_bmi_claim_avg
FROM insurance_data;
